    I did not want to just jump in to any coding program, so I did my research and from the get go, one thing really stood out. The majority of the programs only stress getting a job at the end of the program and not the life component of learning such a skill. I am so excited to learn and love that Shereef puts finding a job second so we can appreciate the whole program and not just the potential of a return at the end.
