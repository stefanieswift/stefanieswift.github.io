      <h1>Using my values to combat stereotype threats</h1>
      <h4>March 1, 2015</h4>
      <p>Stacking my brain for the times when I feel the happiest, these are the values that come to mind. Although I cherish all of these values, the amount I try to live up to them varies. The numbers that each value is associated with represents how much I try to live up to the value, with 5 being I agree and 1 being I disagree.
        <ul>
          <li>accomplishment - 5 </li>
          <li>ambition - 5 </li>
          <li>close relationships - 5</li>
          <li>compassion - 5</li>
          <li>confidence - 5</li>
          <li>creativity - 5</li>
          <li>economic security -5</li>
          <li>enthusiasm - 5</li>
          <li>excitement - 5</li>
          <li>friendships - 5</li>
          <li>introspection - 3</li>
          <li>money - 5 </li>
          <li>meaningful work - 5 </li>
          <li>personal development - 5</li>
          <li>self-respect - 5</li>
          <li>wisdom - 5</li>
          <li>truth - 5</li>
          <li>stability - 5</li>
          <li>physical challenge - 5</li>
          <li>peace - 5</li>
          <li>openness - 5</li>
          <li>growth - 5</li>
          <li>effectiveness - 5</li>
          <li>adventure - 5</li>
          <li>accountability - 5</li>
          <li>achievement - 5</li>
          <li>affection - 5</li>
          <li>challenge - 5</li>
          <li>competition - 3</li>
          <li>decisiveness - 4</li>
          <li>excellence - 4</li>
          <li>having a family - 4</li>
          <li>knowledge - 5 </li>
          <li>music - 5</li>
          <li>self-reliance - 5</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <p>A visible trend in the list above is that almost everything is a 5. This is because I always attempt to make myself happy. One of the values, I especially try to embrace in my daily life is growth. This value is important to me because it affects my everyday life. I find the most job and personal satisfaction by increasing myself. </p>

      <p>Recently a good friend of mine asked about a personal situation where they were feeling trapped and unhappy. I did not want to tell them what I thought they should do, but I did offer them guidance using the value growth. My advice was that if they no longer felt they were growing from the situation, something was wrong and they should make a change. </p>
      <p>Considering these values at Dev Bootcamp will allow me to focus on the big picture and not individual stressors. This will help me not fall victim to stereotype threats. Another method I can use to avoid threats is to take a break and do simple ruby problems to regain my focus and confidence. </p>
