      <h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
      <h4>February 22</h4>
      <p>A stereotype threat is a situation where people feel at risk of conforming to negative social group stereotypes. An example of a stereotype threat is the threat of a woman not performing as she otherwise would in science because of the stereotype that women are not as good as men at science.</p>

      <p>There are many potential consequences of stereotype threats. The first notable consequence is decreased performance in the area where the stereotype is relevant. Going back to the woman in science example, if her performance were to be inferior to what was expected this could be attributable to the stereotype. The second consequence of a stereotype threat, can be thought of as a benefit, and that is increased performance. If our science example resulted in better performance this can be attributable to the threat. Another consequence is self-handicapping,  this is when a person knows about the stereotype so they create barriers for performance to excuse their poor performance.</p>

      <p>I like to think that I am not bothered by stereotype threats, but I know this is a lie. I have in the past been a victim to self-handicapping in situations where I have been a stereotype. It is a struggle to overlook these situations. Now that I know that I do this, I am going to step back to make sure that I do not let a stereotype threat alter my performance again</p>
