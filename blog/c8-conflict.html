      <h1>The conflict conundrum</h1>
      <h2>How to solve conflict with creating more conflict?</h2>
      <h4>March 8</h4>
      <p>In one of my previous jobs, I was working on a group project and the group was torn on the best method for accomplishing our goal. I am usually someone who goals with the flow, but I was certain that the method a few of us wanted to attempt was better in this situation. After making our case, we were still met with resistance from one member of the group. They were bottlenecking the whole operation, halting further work until we agreed with them. There was a tight timeline for the project, so finally I agreed to a compromise. The conflict was immediately diffused, but what we didn’t know is that it would be back to get us. </p>
      <p>The project ended up being far inferior to what we could have done, based mainly on the consequences of our settlement. The settlement itself was not the problem, but it caused a chain reaction of inefficiencies. This resulted in our group being on ends with each other and we all left feeling bitter.</p>
<p>Part of me was embarrassed to share this story on such a public forum, but I think it’s important to learn from this. Looking back I would have tried to dig deeper into why we were having the conflict in the first place and better ways to solve it. I also would be sure to not jump into a conclusion, but really research the potential outcomes and take a deep breath before deciding anything.</p>
