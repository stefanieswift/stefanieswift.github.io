      <h1>Thinking style</h1>
      <h2>life at DBC for a concrete random thinker</h2>
      <h4>february 1</h4>
      <p>Anthony Gregorc created a Mind Styles Model in 1984 to show how the mind works. The model is based on two qualities: (1) perceptual qualities; and (2)ordering ability. Concretely, the perceptual quality, allows you to register information through your five senses and abstractly to conceive and believe things that cannot be seen. The ordering ability sequentially allows for the mind to create organization linearly and randomly allows the mind to create orgaganization by chunks. These two qualties are present in every person in a varying degree and create four thinking styles: (1) Concrete Sequential; (2) Abstract Random; (3) Abstract Sequential; and (4) Concrete Random.</p>
      <p>My thinking style is concrete random. As a concrete thinker I like to find answers through experimenting, take risks, use my gut, and find answers independently. I learn best by trying and retrying and a little competition never hurts my desire to solve a problem. I love learning and have always found it a desirable experience that comes relatively easy to me. I do have limitations, however, I find formal reports, detailed records, and routines painstaking. They are mundane for me and I often find them pointelss or having an exaggerted purpose.</p>
      <p>My biggest struggle at DBC has been with the blogging and reflection aspect. I can never adequatly express my thoughts through these venues feeling a pressure to write just to write. I have always had trouble with these type of assignments because while I understand there could be a value but it seeems the value is less than that of doing more coding problems. The humourous part of this is I enjoy blogging by itself, but not when it is forced.</p>
      <p>I am going to start working on the blog post as I do the assignments over the week to make it feel less forced and more beneficial. I am also going to start really working on my writing style to make it seem more beneficial in that aspect as well.</p>
