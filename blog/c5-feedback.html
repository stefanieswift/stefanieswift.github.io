      <h1>So much feedback</h1>
      <h2>but, does it help?</h2>
      <h4>February 15</h4>
      <h4> Dev Bootcamp Pairing </h4>
      <p>Dev Bootcamp is very big into pairing and feedback. The school stresses this because they want our emotional self to be on pair with our technical self to properly prepare for the workforce. Being completely honest, I find myself ambivalent on pairing. In some senses it is less efficient and halts my creative juices, while at the same time two minds can be better than one. I have decided it has a lot to do with who you pair with and your thinking styles. One of my partners, I have been with a few times and we get on very well. We understand how we work and can utilize our strengths to compile a great working style. The advantage with pairing with everyone is that you learn a better communication style.</p>
      <h4> Dev Bootcamp Feedback </h4>
      <p>Feedback is a funny thing at Dev Bootcamp. It is crucially important, but I feel that people have trouble giving it, do not want to be rude, or get defensive and give harsher than necessary feedback. I understand, as I struggle to write any feedback. It requires us to explore how a stranger can improve and a lot of times we just do not know. </p>
      <p> My feedback has been very fair and honest. I am awful at driving, or just writing down what the navigator tells me to. I want to try to find the solution. I want to play and explore. I want to always be the navigator and I cannot be. That is not real. And, this is where the pairing and feedback system show their importance. In this work environment you really need to be able to work with another person regardless of your strengths and weaknesses and succeed. </p>
