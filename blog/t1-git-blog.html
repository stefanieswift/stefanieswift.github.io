   This week marks the start of an adventure for. It is so exciting to be in the driver seat of the new chapter of my life. I am ready and rolling. Much like starting on an actual drive before you hit the road you need to have the basics ready: some direction, gas, and the knowledge to operate your vehicle safely. This weeks lessons involved a lot of learning the basics of where to store my code, how often to save it, and tricks to get my computer to perform in ways that I never knew where possible.

     Getting started was way too much fun. I have had my Mac computer for over two years now and for the first time I learned about a the command terminal of the computer that allows a user to open files, change files, look inside folders, use a version controlled software called git, and communicate with GitHub. Before this week, I was well aware of GitHub having used it to store markdown files for a previous employer and reporting issues in various companies. I never knew the difference between git and github however. Where GitHub stores your code, Git tracks every time a user makes a commit, or saves, a section of code. This is crucial as a coder, because it allows you the safety net of saving previous code that may have accidentally gotten deleted or creates the opportunity to spot issues easier, as the old code can be compared to the new code. All of these changes will then be saved and accessible inside of GitHub. While there are other places you can store your code, using GitHub is advantageous because it is a safe-place, in the cloud, and is used by the predominant number of coders making sharing and discovering code very easy.

Overall this has been a great week and I am so excited to continue the journey
