      <h1>Where are all the women?</h1>
      <h2>being a women in tech</h2>
      <h4>February 8</h4>
    <p>Being a women has a magnitude of advantages, including being invited to join other intelligent ladies at coding events. At one such talk, I learned about an interesting statistic. Men account for 85% of the technical employees at the major tech companies. The number did not shock me, but it did not make me feel warm and cozy either. Where are the women?</p>
    <p>No matter where you look there are a variety of reasons. They all boil down to numbers however. There are not enough women who are in the industry or perhaps want to be in the industry. My conundrum is while I want the industry to be gender equal, I am concerned the push to hire women engineers will result in the hiring of under qualified engineers potentially tainting the view of women engineers everywhere.</p>
    <p>I can only hope that as more women join the industry, we get the reputation I know we deserve. That we are some of the most talented and able engineers in the industry.</p>
