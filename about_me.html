      <p>My name is Stefanie and I have recently moved to the bay area in California. Cooking is my escape from daily pressures into the land of anywhere my imagination and palate takes me.</p>

<p>While getting my law degree I worked at a restaurant in Williamsburg, Virginia and realized food would always have to have a major part in my life.</p>

<p>Some things in life you just have to be passionate about. Even with all the hoopla, Penn State football is one of those. And Food, well food has always been a passion of mine. While other kids were making mud pies I was creating super bowl cakes complete with yardage markers piped on the field.</p>

<p>My sister/roommate/best friend is getting her degree at UC Berkeley. While she’s hard at work on papers, I’m coming home and making us mini feasts. Good music, great food, a glass of wine and if we’re lucky family and friends to share them with</p>
